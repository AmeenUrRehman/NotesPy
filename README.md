# NotesPy

NotesPy is a simple command-line interface (CLI) program for taking notes in Python. It allows you to create, view, update, and delete notes from the terminal. The program stores the notes as text files on your local machine.

## Installation

To use NotesPy, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check if you have Python 3 installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone the NotesPy repository to your local machine by running the following command:
